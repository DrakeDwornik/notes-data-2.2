#Problem Solving
* We don't know nothing, so solve
* We are drowning in information quote, work into origin story
* Get Specs!!!!
* **REALLY THINK ABOUT REQUIREMENTS**
* Like in Cat's Cradle, you must be able to explain something to understand it
#We're not gonna plan
* **Don't be silly, PLAN!**
#Take X spit out Y
*Repeat
*start with a framework of comments

#When Stumpped
* DONT'T PANIC
* It's fun!
* Three Things to do
    1. Debug (make sure there's progress, otherwise take a breath)
    2. reassess (can mean start from scratch)
    3. Google (see if others solved it)
# SAY IT!
1. understand
2. plan

4. compose
