##Buzzwords
### How to move data
**Transaction**: Keeps stuff together or not at all (important groups of data)

**Data Stream**: Every datum is its own entity, just get it where it goes

**Pipeline**: How the data moves, in a datatstream some can be lost, oh well

**Map Reduce**: lots of small bundles of data, let it go and then combine it at the end

**Single Thread**: gather data, then move it all at once.

###Where is Data Run
**Dedicated Server**: Like a vacation home, you own it, for keeping it the most personal and total control

**AWS EC2**: Short term rental of equipment

### Uncategorized for later
**ETL**: Extract, Transform, Load

**NLP**: Natural Language Processing

**SSR**: Server Side Rendering
