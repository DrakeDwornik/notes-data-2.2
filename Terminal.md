#Terminal Tricks
A few tricks for the terminal not covered in the tutorial
##The Tilde (~)
The `~` character (towards the top left of the keyboard) represents your come folder (on an Apple that is /Users/\<username\>

This is a useful shortcut when changing directories or opening files for example do change to your `Documents` directory you can type `cd ~` in your terminal, this will also work sometimes in software that uses the MacOS interface too

Additionally you can use it to open files eg `pico ~/dev/My-Project/readme.md`

##\<TAB\> Completion
When typing a long file path or filename on the caommand line it can be inconvenient to type the whole thing (and type prone), for example, if trying to change to the directory `~/dev/My-Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious-Project` can be a burden to tpye, and type accurately. Instead, one can type `cd ~/dev/My-Super<TAB>` and it will autocomplete the rest of the directory name. If there is more than one matching directory/file

## pico/nano
pico or nano are built in editors, the shortcuts are listed at the bottom, ^ means CTRL, Write Out (^O) means save
